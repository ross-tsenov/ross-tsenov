Hey! I'm [@ross-tsenov](https://github.com/ross-tsenov) (Rostyslav-Mykola Tsenov). ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer originally from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, now living in Ontario, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦.

With 6 years of professional experience and about 10 years of coding for fun, I excel in backend development, building internal tools for developers, and integrating AI into existing softwareâ€”or even creating completely new solutions from the ground up. ðŸ’»

I specialize in the integration of computer vision models and large language models (LLMs), crafting innovative solutions that bring the best of both worlds together. ðŸš€

I love working with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and the [Encode stack](https://github.com/encode). If you share the same passion, feel free to explore my repositories or connect! ðŸ¤“

I'm currently diving into [HTMX](https://htmx.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), and [Ollama LLMs](https://ollama.com/), expanding my toolkit and exploring new horizons. ðŸŒ±
